<h1>Poker</h1>
<h2>A C# game which simulates a game of Poker</h2>
<h3>Game is not finished yet...</h3>
Game is now playable. Ultimately, the code needs quite a lot of refactoring, however. Compared to a real Poker game, Player 1 (me) is always the last player to bet - all players should take it in turns to bet.
